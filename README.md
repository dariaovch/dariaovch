### Hi, I'm Daria, Junior Frontend-Developer 👋

🔭  &nbsp; I’ve completed the Web Development training course and Development of Complex Front-end applications on React.js course.
🌱  &nbsp; I’m currently learning Frontend-testing, Angular & TypeScript.
❤️  &nbsp; Frontend development is my passion, which allows me to move forward and makes me think how to best utilize my skills.
⭐  &nbsp; I'm eager to become a higly qualified professional in my sphere.
👯  &nbsp; I'm able to effectively collaborate as part of a productive team.
🤔  &nbsp; At the moment I’m looking for a great job in Frontend!
😄  &nbsp; My hobbies are cross-country ski, sci-fi, Playstation videogames and Manchester United football team.
🐶  &nbsp; When I find me a position, I'll certainly get a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (have you ever seen how cute they are?).
